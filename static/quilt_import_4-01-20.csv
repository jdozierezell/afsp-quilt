Loved dirt bikes, 4 wheelers, being outdoors, and Ironman.  Everyone told us ""He would give you the shirt off his back. He was such a good friend.""  Our reply was, ""Pay it forward.  Be that kind of person to someone else. Continue the legacy."" Matthew reminded me of Robin Williams.  He always made others laugh.  He was always concerned about other people.
